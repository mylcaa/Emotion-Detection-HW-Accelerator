## generic unnecessary commands:
    - **git config --global user.name "name"** //setting up name for pc
    - **git config --global email emailaddress** //setting up email for pc
    - **git help command** // use HELP to check info about command

## very important commands:
    - **git status** // checks the status of your files / git 
    - **git log** // checks the log of your commits
    - **git commit -m"comment of a log"** // it's very important to comment logs
    - **git diff** // used to check the difference between commits
    - **git restore --staged file_name** // untracks - restores the file to the last commit
    - **git rm file_name** // better use your own terminal commands
    - **git commit -m"text" -- ammend** // change name of the last commit
    - **git branch name_branch** // CREATE new branch
    - **git checkout name_branch** // jump to the branch you want to use
    - **git merge name_branch** // merge two branches together
    - **git rebase name_branch** // merge two branches so it looks as it was developed sequentially
    - **git checkout name_commit** // DETACH HEAD
    - **git checkout  name_branch^**// asterix ^ means how many commits you want to detach HEAD from name_branch
    - **git branch** // used to see all local branches
    - **git branch -a** // used to see all local and remote branches
    - **git branch -r** // used to see all remote branches

## Switch to a Branch That Came From a Remote Repo
    - **git pull** //to get a list of all branches from the remote, run this command
    - **git checkout --track origin/my-branch-name** // run this command to switch to the branch: 

## Push to a Branch
### Does not exist on the remote 
    - **git push -u origin my-branch-name** // If your local branch does not exist on the remote run this command

### Exists on the remote
    - **git push** // if your local branch already exists on the remote, run this command 

## Delete Branches
### remote branches
    - **git push origin --delete my-branch-name** // To delete a remote branch, run this command

### local branches 
    - **git branch -d branch_name** // To delete a local branch, run this command
    **NOTE:** The -d option only deletes the branch if it has already been merged. 
    The -D option is a shortcut for --delete --force, which deletes the branch irrespective of its merged status.
    
## configuring git branche names
    - Work should be separated depending on its nature, not on who will work on it.

    - **Samy Dindane** : *"This is what I'd suggest:*
     *Use feature branches: Most of your work should be on these topic branches, except tiny commits (such as typos, etc.).*
     *When you have a feature, bug fix, or a ticket that should be processed: create a branch feat-something, and work in there.*
     *Use a dev, or release-X (where X is the release's number) branch: When a feature's branch work is done, tested, and works, rebase it into dev.*
     *Never commit on master, this branch should only be rebased into by the lead developer, CTO, whatever. Rebase dev's work into master when you feel it's needed.*

     *This is (basically) how we work on a very big project. You can work without the dev branch if your project isn't big. "*
